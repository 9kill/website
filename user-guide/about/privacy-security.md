# Privacy and Security

We're hosted on AWS and follow best practices:
1. All our servers are in a private network and are not accessible from the Internet, except for the load balancer and a bastion server for SSH (that does not have any credentials on it).
2. HTTPS/SSL for everything.
3. 2FA for our internal systems.

If you have any specific concerns, please contact us and we'll be happy to help.
