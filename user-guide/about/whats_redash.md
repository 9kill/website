# What's Redash?

Redash is an open source tool for teams to query, visualize and collaborate. Redash is quick to setup and works with any data source you might need so you can query from anywhere in no time.

Share your results and dashboards with other team members and empower your entire organization to be data driven with no-code filters and parameters that instantly adjust. Get alerts for pre-defined triggers to your email, Slack or Hipchat (you can setup a custom webhook as well).

Redash is our take on freeing the data within our company in a way that will better fit our culture and usage patterns. We tried to use traditional BI suites and discovered a set of bloated, technically challenged and slow tools/flows. What we were looking for was a more hacker’ish way to look at data, so we built one.

Redash was built to allow fast and easy access to billions of records, that we process and collect using Amazon Redshift (“petabyte scale data warehouse” that “speaks” PostgreSQL). Today Redash has support for querying multiple databases, including: Redshift, Google BigQuery,Google Spreadsheets, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Graphite and custom scripts.
