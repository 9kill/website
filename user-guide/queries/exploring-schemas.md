# Exploring Schemas

Once you select the data source you want to query, its schema will appear to the left. Clicking each table will show its columns.

You can also search for columns in the query editor search bar!
Most databases should properly show the schema, please contact us if you encouter an issue with that.

Please note that schemas update periodically - to update it immediately use the API or contact us.
