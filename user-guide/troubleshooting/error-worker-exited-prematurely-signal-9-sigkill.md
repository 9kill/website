# Error Running Query: Worker Exited Prematurely: Signal 9 (SIGKILL)

If you get an error saying "Error running query: Worker exited prematurely: signal 9 (SIGKILL)" it might indicate the the query runner ran out of memory - this usually happens with large result sets.

Try to run the query once more to make sure it wasn't some momentary thing. If it happens again, contact support.
