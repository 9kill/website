# How to write a query?

For SQL databases just use the native syntax for that database.

Redash supports live auto-complete - just start typing and you'll get the relevant suggestions.

For schemas with more than 5000 tables+columns start typing and then hit ctrl/cmd+spacebar to see suggestions.

For NoSQL languages Redash has a few nuances:

* [Querying ElasticSearch](queries/querying_elasticsearch.md)
* [Querying JIRA (JQL)](queries/querying_jira_jql.md)
* [Querying MongoDB](queries/querying_mongodb.md)
