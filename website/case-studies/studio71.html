                <h2>About Studio71</h2>
                <p>A media company and content studio, Studio71 works with artists, actors and YouTubers (like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Rhett and Link, etc) to develop, produce and distribute content on various channels. Studio71 is a Red Arrow Studios Company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in Berlin, New York, Toronto, London, Paris and Milan.</p>
                <p>For six years, Mike has worked as CTO at Studio71 where they’ve been using Redash since 2016. We’ve asked Mike to share his story about how he has transformed Studio71 into a more data-driven company.</p>
                <h2>The challenge</h2>
                <p>Tracking, managing and querying various data sources from different databases makes for a challenging and time-consuming task. Before using Redash, the tech team spent a lot of resources getting their data in hand, visualizing and creating custom interfaces for reporting. It took several days of development time to create those reports and things didn’t move as quickly as they wanted.</p>
                <p><blockquote>Especially in our business, monitoring all the different social networks and all the different data sources coming in caused increasingly great pain.</blockquote></p>
                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>Mike wanted a solution that allowed the company to work closer with their data. This led them to using Redash.</p>
                <p><blockquote>I think the number one thing that drew my eye was the flexibility. We had data coming in from Google Analytics, elasticsearch. We still have multiple SQL databases. We've got some NoSQL databases banging around. So we've got a lot of different data sources.</blockquote></p>
                <p><blockquote>When I came across Redash, I found that list of what it supports. I was like, this is most of them! So that was obviously a huge positive development when I saw that.</blockquote></p>
                <p>Mike receives a lot of questions from other executives, board members and their parent company. “How much is this costing?” and “What is working and how?” just marked the start of it. Redash proved to be the right place to get all their data together and respond to those questions swiftly:</p>
                <p><blockquote>I automated with Redash within an hour or two, sitting down and just writing queries and playing with visualizations.</blockquote></p>
                <h2>The outcome</h2>
                <h4>Using Redash to bring data closer</h4>
                <p>Redash has become a huge time saver for Studio71. They can write queries, visualize their data, and embed visualizations to reports. This saves the tech team a lot of time as they don't need to build custom solutions.</p>
                <p><blockquote>I could write a query in a meeting. I've got some great graphs up, I add it to my rotating screen and we can track it. That was a big change for us and improved monitoring of all these stat collections systems we have.</blockquote></p>
                <h4>Using Redash to save time and track more</h4>
                <p>It used to entail a complicated process which required them to make a dev ticket and have it work through the process. Now very simply, they just write a single query and and share the link to the visualization.</p>
                <p><blockquote>Time saving is a big one. We have a lot lot of data sources. It's a lot of different teams in our company that all have very different requirements for data.</blockquote></p>
                <p>Making sure we track even the most trivial thing and monitor it with a query in Redash became a standard that helps the business in various ways.</p>
                <p><blockquote>Even if it's a new webpage, that's less about database entries. We can still add the Google Analytics into Redash and instead of giving everyone analytics access all the time, we could have them go to Redash and see the report. So that's been probably the second biggest thing, the completeness of our ability to track success metrics.</blockquote></p>
                <h4>Using Redash to support sales</h4>
                <p>Sales and the network team (the team working with influencers) consume the most data.</p>
                <p><blockquote>A lot of what we do is the stats for sales.</blockquote></p>
                <p>Redash supports sales with critical business data, like which of their influencers would make sense for different brands.</p>
                <p><blockquote>And then the other side of our sales support is responding to questions like: "Show me all of our branded videos that have done better than projected”. A lot of our data isn't as traditional sales data but it all gets used through Redash.</blockquote></p>
